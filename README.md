## 🔍 Trust The Math (Why This is Public)

We operate on the principle of **"Security by Transparency"**. If a password generator hides its code, how do you know it isn't sending your passwords to its own server? 

By making the FrankPass cryptographic engine 100% open for verification, we issue an ongoing challenge: **Read the code.** You will see that everything executes locally in your browser leveraging native WebCrypto APIs (`crypto.subtle`). 

Disconnect your Wi-Fi, turn on Airplane mode, and generate your passwords. *It will still work flawlessly.* Don't trust us. Trust the math.

## What is FrankPass?

FrankPass is a **deterministic, stateless password generation ecosystem** built on pure browser-side cryptography. It generates strong, unique passwords for every platform — without storing anything, anywhere. Unlike traditional password managers, there is no "vault" to hack.

- ✅ **Zero Database**: No account, no cloud, no tracking.
- ✅ **Stateless UI**: Same inputs &rarr; Same password. Every device. 
- ✅ **Adaptive Pricing**: Localized payment options (INR/USD) for Pro users.
- ✅ **Stateless Contact**: Privacy-first messaging via direct app links.
- ✅ **PWA Native**: Install on iOS/Android. Works 100% offline.
- ✅ **28,500+ Platforms**: Industry-leading auto-suggest database.

## How It Works

FrankPass uses a 4-stage cryptographic pipeline, entirely inside your browser:

1. **HMAC-SHA512** — Generates a local pepper from your inputs
2. **1,000 SHA-256 rounds** — Stretches the pepper
3. **PBKDF2 (1,000,000 iterations, SHA-512)** — Derives a master key
4. **HMAC expansion** — Produces the final password bytes

Your password is **calculated, never stored.** Close the tab = data gone.

## Security Design

- **No ambiguous characters** in output (removed: `l`, `I`, `O`, `0`, `1`, `C`, `c`, `S`, `s`, `V`, `v`, `W`, `w`)
- **Symbols restricted to safe set:** `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `+`, `*`, `=`
- **Entropy:** 55-character charset × 16+ length = astronomically secure
- **Algorithm:** PBKDF2-SHA512 with 1,000,000 iterations (industry standard)
